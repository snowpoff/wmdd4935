<h1>I can explain. It's very valuable.</h1>
<p>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</p>
<p>Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? <strong> Is that a cooking show?</strong> <em> In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up!</em> Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>
<h2>Take me to your leader!</h2>
<p>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! It's toe-tappingly tragic! I love you, buddy! Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</p>
<ol>

    <li>Why not indeed!</li><li>We're rescuing ya.</li><li>I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? It's toe-tappingly tragic!</p>
<ul>

    <li>Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.</li><li>Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.</li><li>Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</li>

</ul>

<p>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!</p>
<p>For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p>
<p>Say it in Russian! Negative, bossy meat creature! I never loved you. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>
<p>Why would I want to know that? Hey, guess what you're accessories to. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit... that's why I'm transferring to business school! You can see how I lived before I met you.</p>
<p>Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</p>
<p>Can we have Bender Burgers again? Soothe us with sweet lies. Yeah, lots of people did. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>
<p>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! How much did you make me? I had more, but you go ahead. Who are you, my warranty?! Why did you bring us here? Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</p>
<p>Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Okay, I like a challenge. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
<p>Soothe us with sweet lies. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. You lived before you met me?! Ask her how her day was. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! You can see how I lived before I met you.</p>
<p>Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates... PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.</p>
<p>Do a flip! Can we have Bender Burgers again? I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
